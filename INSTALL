  =======================

  1. Requirements

     Make sure you have Perl 5 already installed.   If not do this first by
     grabbing the Perl 5 distribution from any CPAN site:
     http://www.perl.org/perl/CPAN.

     Now install the packages a2ps and psutils on your system.  NLP is
     designed to work with a2ps 4.6.1 and psutils 1.17.  The sources can be
     found in the contrib/ directory of the NLP distribution.
     
  2. Configuring the source

     $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/nlp

  3. Build the programs

     $ make

  4. Install the programs into
     /path/to/nlp/{bin,man,lib[/nlp]}/:

     $ make install

  5. Install a printer.cap file holding your printer list into
     /path/to/nlp/lib[/nlp]}/printer.cap
     Use one of the files in the cap/ directory of the distribution as an
     example.

  6. Cleanup

     $ make distclean
