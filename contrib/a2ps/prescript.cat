       prescript - LaTeX-like language for Postscript generation


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t  has  been  designed  in  conjunction with _a_2_p_s.
       _a_2_p_s is an ASCII to PostScript converter with the  ability
       to  pretty  print  sources for different languages. Hence,
       bold sequences, special characters etc.  were  implemented
       in  _a_2_p_s.  To  allow  the direct access to those features,
       _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t became an input language for _a_2_p_s, were  special
       font treatments are specified in a LaTeX-like syntax.

       The  main  advantages  for using _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t are: it is very
       simple, it is LaTeX compatible (that is, correctly written
       _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t  files do compile with LaTeX); _a_2_p_s is small and
       easy to install, hence it is available on every UNIX plat-
       form.  It  can  be  a  good  candidate  for  generation of
       postscript output (syntactical pretty-printers, generation
       of various reports etc.).


SSYYNNTTAAXX
       Every  command name begins by a backslash (\). If the com-
       mand uses an argument, it is given  between  curly  braces
       with  no spaces between the command name and the argument.

       The main limit on _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t is that no command can be used
       inside  another  command.  For instance, though it is per-
       fectly legal in LaTeX, the following line  will  be  badly
       interpreted by _a_2_p_s:

            \textbf{Problems  using \textit{prescript} instead of
       \LaTeX}

       The correct way to write this in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t is

            \textbf{Problems      using}       \textbi{prescript}
       \textbf{instead of} \LaTeX.

       Everything  from  an  unquoted  %  to  the  end of line is
       ignored (comments).

       \\tteexxttssyy{{_t_e_x_t}}
             _t_e_x_t is written in the Postscript symbol font.  This
             feature  is  not compatible with LaTeX. It is recom-
             mended, when possible, to use the  special  keywords
             denoting symbols, which are compatible with LaTeX.

   SSppeecciiaall ssyymmbboollss
       There  is  a big menagerie of symbols. To get its list, it
       is suggested to print _a_2_p_s's report about _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t  using
       the command line:

            a2ps -Wprescript | a2ps -kprescript

       The  reader  should  be  aware  that LaTeX is more exigent
       about the special symbols. Most of them  must  be  in  so-
       called  math  mode,  which  means that the command must be
       inside $ signs. For instance, though
            If \forall x \in E, x \in F then E \subseteq F.
       is perfectly legal in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t, it should be written
            If $\forall x \in E, x \in F$ then $E \subseteq F$.
       for LaTeX. Since in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t every $ is discarded (unless
       quoted by a \), the second form is also admitted.

   SSppeecciiaall cchhaarraacctteerrss
       $  is  ignored  in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t for compatibility with LaTeX,
       and % introduces a comment. Hence they are the only symbol
       which  have  to be quoted by a \. The following characters
       should also be quoted to produce good LaTeX files, but are
       accepted  by  _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t: _, &, #.  Note that _i_n_s_i_d_e _a _c_o_m_-
       _m_a_n_d, like \textbf, the quotation mechanism does not  work
       in  _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t  (\texrm{#$%} writes #$%) though LaTeX still
       requires quotation. Hence whenever special  characters  or
       symbols  are  introduced, they should be at the outer most
       level.

   QQuuoottaattiioonn
       There is a general mechanism to  avoid  special  sequences
       from being interpreted: the commands \verb+_q_u_o_t_e_d _s_t_r_i_n_g+,
       where + can be any symbol in +, !, |, #, =.

       Some LaTeX commands have no equivalent in  _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t,  but
       are  simply  skipped  at  compilation time (if immediately
       followed by an end-of-line):

       Everything between

       and

            %%prescript:piks
       will be ignored in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t, so that there can  lay  com-
       mand definitions for LaTeX exclusively.

       The  commands  \textbi  (for bold-italic) and \textsy (for
       symbol) do not exist in LaTeX.  They should be defined  in
       the preamble:
       %%prescript:skip
       \newcommand{\textbi}[1]{\textbf{\it #1}}
       \newcommand{\textsy}[1]{#1}
       %%prescript:piks

       There  is  no way in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t to get an automatic number-
       ing. There are no equivalent to the LaTeX environment _e_n_u_-
       _m_e_r_a_t_e. But every command beginning by \text is doubled by
       a command beginning by \magic. _a_2_p_s behave the same way on
       both  families  of  command.  Hence, if one specifies that
       arguments of that  functions  should  be  ignored  in  the
       preamble of the LaTeX document, the numbering is emulated.
       For instance
       \begin{enumerate}
       \magicbf{1.}item First line
       \magicbf{2.}item Second line
       \end{enumerate}
       will be treated the same way both in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t and  LaTeX.

       Some symbols are available in _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t but not in LaTeX:

       A good example of a LaTeX preamble to  get  LaTeX  compile
       _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t files is given by the report of _a_2_p_s.

       _p_r_e_s_c_r_i_p_t  and _a_2_p_s can be used for one-the-fly formating.
