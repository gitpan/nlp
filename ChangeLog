  Changes between 2.9 and 2.10
  ----------------------------
  961103 o now a2ps and the psutils are no longer part of the 
           nlp distribution. They have to be installed before nlp gets
           installed. The "configure" script now find them in the PATH.

  Changes between 2.8 and 2.9
  ---------------------------
  960304 o added more output variants of manpages
         o fixed a great bug in option handling. A simple
           "nlp <options> <file1> <file2> ..." leads to printing of <file1> with
           <options> but "<file2> .." were printed without any such options!
           Thanks to Olaf Mueller (mueller@informatik.tu-muenchen.de) for the
           hint!
         o Fixed a second bug in option handling:
           Now "nlp <options1> <file1> <option2> <file2>" are printed correctly,
           .i.e. <file2> has _ONLY_ <options2> applied, not <options1> _AND_
           <options2>. And NLPTOPS are prepended to _BOTH_ <options1> and
           <options2>!

  Changes between 2.7 and 2.8
  ---------------------------
  960207 o moved src/cap to cap and updated sunbroy.cap
         o patched config.guess to accept FreeBSD 2.x-RELEASE etc.
         o fixed a few bugs in nlp.1.in (manpage)
         o fixed more bugs in the manpage (thanks to Traudi Riegg and
           their collegues)
         o added check for Header length (max. 35 chars)

  Changes between 2.6 and 2.7
  ---------------------------
  960207 o fixed a problem with terminal i/o: When the print data
           came from STDIN, then our terminal promps (Y/N, etc.) 
           couldn't read any more characters. Now /dev/tty is
           used (Thanks to Traudi Riegg at TUM)
         o reversed the meaning of "-m" option: It was
           "interpret metachars", now it is "visualize metachars",
           i.e. now NLP interprets metachars per default and
           option "-m" disabled this and visualizes the charcters
           in caret notation.
         o added toplevel headers to all sourcefiles
         o added my email address to the manual-page

  Changes between 2.5 and 2.6
  ---------------------------
  960203 o added -sS for seperated printing, i.e. printing of the 
           odd pages first and then automatically the even pages past.

  Changes between 2.4 and 2.5
  ---------------------------
  960130 o fixed a wrong header name in nlp.1.in: AUTHOR -> COPYRIGHT

  Changes between 2.3 and 2.4
  ---------------------------
  960124 o fixed a few typo bugs in the manpage
           (thanks to Traudi Riegg at TUM)

  Changes between 2.2 and 2.3
  ---------------------------
  960109 o fixed a target problem in toplevel Makefile.in
          
  Changes between 2.1 and 2.2
  ---------------------------
  960109 o added feature: filename "-" means nlp reads from stdin
         o lp commands output is redirected to /dev/null to
           avoid the silly "request id xxx" messages under SysV

  Changes between 2.0 and 2.1
  ---------------------------
  951121 o enhanced the test facility
         o fixed a bug for a2ps -H: now the option
           will be sourrounded by "'" characters to
           prevent -HRalf S. Engelschall instead of the
           corrent one '-HRalf S. Engelschall'
         o fixed a bug with -m: the option was true per default,
           and -m had no effect :-( now -m works correct
         o fixed a bug with -q: $printer was wrong, it is
           $option{'printer'} !
         o fixed a bug in usage output for -P,-d default
         o Added the Copyrights to -V output
         o Highlighted the "resulting" word in nlp.1.in
           to make clear that -s selects only pages
           from the resulting Postscript (not from Source
           when printing ASCII!)
         o Added support for pure portrait with borders!!
         o Added a explicit simplex mode option to
           force printers in duplex-is-default-mode to
           print simplex
         o Added -S (simplex mode) to the manual page
         o Added -s r option to nlp.1.in manual page
         o Updated the overview section in nlp.1.in
         o Now -V is directed to STDERR (similar to usage!)
         o Added Copyright notice to manual pages

  Changes between 1.x and 2.0
  ---------------------------
  950607 o releases new NLP, completely rewritten in Perl 5
         o ...
